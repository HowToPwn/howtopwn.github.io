# Introduction to Reverse Engineering: Analyzing Binary Code

Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing software to understand its functionality, structure, and behavior without access to the original source code. This skill is essential for malware analysis, vulnerability research, and software security assessment.

## What is Reverse Engineering?

Reverse engineering involves taking apart software to understand how it works. This can include:
- Analyzing compiled binaries
- Understanding assembly code
- Identifying algorithms and data structures
- Finding vulnerabilities and backdoors

## Types of Reverse Engineering

### 1. Static Analysis
Examining code without executing it:
- Disassembly
- Decompilation
- String analysis
- Import/export analysis

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
Running the program and observing its behavior:
- Debugging
- API monitoring
- Network analysis
- Memory analysis

### 3. Hybrid Analysis
Combining static and dynamic techniques:
- Symbolic execution
- Taint analysis
- Fuzzing
- Code coverage analysis

## Understanding Assembly

### x86 Architecture

**Registers**
```assembly
; General purpose registers
eax, ebx, ecx, edx
esi, edi, ebp, esp

; Special registers
eip - Instruction pointer
eflags - Status flags
```

**Common Instructions**
```assembly
mov eax, 0x12345678    ; Move value to register
add eax, ebx           ; Add registers
sub eax, 0x10         ; Subtract immediate value
call function_name     ; Call function
ret                    ; Return from function
push eax              ; Push to stack
pop ebx               ; Pop from stack
```

### x64 Architecture

**Registers**
```assembly
; 64-bit general purpose
rax, rbx, rcx, rdx
rsi, rdi, rbp, rsp
r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, r15

; Special registers
rip - Instruction pointer
rflags - Status flags
```

## Analysis Techniques

### 1. String Analysis
Looking for readable strings in the binary:
```bash
strings program.exe
```

### 2. Import Analysis
Identifying external functions:
```bash
objdump -T program.exe
```

### 3. Function Analysis
Understanding program flow:
- Entry points
- Function calls
- Control flow
- Data flow

### 4. Malware Analysis
Specific techniques for malicious software:
- Sandbox analysis
- Network behavior
- File system changes
- Registry modifications

## Common Patterns

### 1. Function Prologue
```assembly
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
sub esp, 0x20
```

### 2. Function Epilogue
```assembly
mov esp, ebp
pop ebp
ret
```

### 3. String Operations
```assembly
lea eax, [string_address]
push eax
call printf
add esp, 4
```

### 4. Loop Patterns
```assembly
mov ecx, 0
loop_start:
cmp ecx, 10
jge loop_end
inc ecx
jmp loop_start
loop_end:
```

## Practical Examples

### 1. Simple CrackMe
```c
// Original C code
int check_password(char* input) {
    if (strcmp(input, "secret123") == 0) {
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**Assembly equivalent:**
```assembly
check_password:
    push ebp
    mov ebp, esp
    push "secret123"
    push [ebp+8]
    call strcmp
    add esp, 8
    test eax, eax
    jz password_correct
    mov eax, 0
    jmp end
password_correct:
    mov eax, 1
end:
    pop ebp
    ret
```

### 2. Anti-Debugging Techniques
```assembly
; Check for debugger
push 0
call IsDebuggerPresent
test eax, eax
jnz debugger_detected
```
