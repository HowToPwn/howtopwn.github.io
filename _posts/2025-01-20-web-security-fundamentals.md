# Web Security Fundamentals: Understanding Common Vulnerabilities

Web applications are the backbone of modern internet services, but they're also prime targets for attackers. Understanding common web vulnerabilities is essential for both developers and security professionals.

## The OWASP Top 10

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a list of the most critical web application security risks. Let's explore the most common ones:

### 1. Injection Attacks

**SQL Injection (SQLi)**
SQL injection occurs when user input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

```sql
-- Vulnerable query
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '$user_input' AND password = '$password'

-- Malicious input
' OR '1'='1' --
```

**Prevention:**
- Use parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Least privilege database accounts

**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**
XSS allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

```javascript
// Reflected XSS example
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
```

**Prevention:**
- Output encoding
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Input validation

### 2. Broken Authentication

Common authentication vulnerabilities include:
- Weak password policies
- Session fixation
- Insecure session management
- Brute force attacks

**Best Practices:**
- Implement strong password requirements
- Use secure session management
- Implement account lockout policies
- Multi-factor authentication

### 3. Sensitive Data Exposure

**Common Issues:**
- Unencrypted data transmission
- Weak encryption algorithms
- Insecure storage of sensitive data
- Missing security headers

**Protection:**
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement proper encryption
- Secure data storage
- Security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)

## Common Attack Vectors

### 1. File Upload Vulnerabilities

Attackers may upload malicious files to execute code on the server.

**Prevention:**
- File type validation
- File size limits
- Secure file storage location
- Virus scanning

### 2. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

CSRF forces authenticated users to perform unwanted actions.

**Example:**
```html
<img src="http://bank.com/transfer?amount=1000&to=attacker" style="display:none">
```

**Prevention:**
- CSRF tokens
- SameSite cookies
- Custom headers

### 3. Directory Traversal

Attackers access files outside the intended directory.

**Example:**
```
../../../etc/passwd
..\..\..\windows\system32\config\sam
```

**Prevention:**
- Input validation
- Path canonicalization
- Access controls

## Security Testing Tools

### 1. Burp Suite
- Web application security testing
- Intercepting proxy
- Vulnerability scanning
- Manual testing

### 2. OWASP ZAP
- Open-source security testing
- Automated scanning
- API testing
- CI/CD integration

### 3. Nikto
- Web server scanner
- Known vulnerabilities
- Server misconfigurations
- Outdated software

### 4. SQLMap
- Automated SQL injection
- Database enumeration
- Data extraction
- Post-exploitation

## Secure Development Practices

### 1. Input Validation
```python
# Good example
import re
def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None
```

### 2. Output Encoding
```python
# HTML encoding
import html
user_input = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"
safe_output = html.escape(user_input)
```

### 3. Parameterized Queries
```python
# SQL injection prevention
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s AND password = %s", (username, password))
```

## Security Headers

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
```

### 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

### 3. X-Frame-Options
```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

### 4. X-Content-Type-Options
```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Reconnaissance
- Information gathering
- Technology identification
- Attack surface mapping

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- Automated scanning
- Manual testing
- Code review

### 3. Exploitation
- Proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Documentation

### 4. Reporting
- Detailed findings
- Risk assessment
- Remediation recommendations

## Resources for Learning

### Online Labs
- **OWASP WebGoat**: Deliberately insecure application
- **DVWA**: Damn Vulnerable Web Application
- **bWAPP**: Buggy Web Application
- **Juice Shop**: Modern vulnerable application

### Books
- "The Web Application Hacker's Handbook"
- "OWASP Testing Guide"
- "Web Application Security"
- "Hacking Web Applications"

### Certifications
- **OSCP**: Offensive Security Certified Professional
- **CEH**: Certified Ethical Hacker
- **GWAPT**: GIAC Web Application Penetration Tester
- **OSWE**: Offensive Security Web Expert

## Conclusion

Web security is a complex field that requires continuous learning and practice. Understanding common vulnerabilities and their prevention methods is crucial for building secure web applications.

Remember, security is not a one-time effort but an ongoing process. Regular testing, monitoring, and updates are essential for maintaining a secure web application.
